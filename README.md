# SCAUNIFEI

File sharing system made in Node.js with MongoDB, supporting user register, edit and delete, file upload (by selected users) and download and search by multiple standards.

## Installation

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), the normal version already comes with NPM
* Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

* Install all dependencies from the package.json file in the current folder, in the Terminal type the following command (you need a package manager):

```bash
npm install
```

* Create a folder in your local drive called ```data``` and another one inside it called ```db```:
```bash
C:\data\db
```

* Add Mongoâ€™s bin folder to the [Path Environment Variable](https://dangphongvanthanh.wordpress.com/2017/06/12/add-mongos-bin-folder-to-the-path-environment-variable/) (for Windows).

## Usage

* Create the file ```db.js``` in the folder ```config``` with the following code:

```node
if (process.env.NODE_ENV == "production") {
    //URL to your Cloud database
    module.exports = { mongoURI: "mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster_name.mongodb.net/database_name?retryWrites=true&w=majority" }
}
else {
    //Local URL to access via Browser (27017 is Mongo default connection PORT)
    module.exports = { mongoURI: "mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/database_name" }
}
```

* Start MongoDB, in the Terminal type the following command:

```bash
mongod
```

* Create a new database and admin:

```sql
mongo

use nameofthedatabase
db.createUser(
  {
    user: "myDatabaseAdmin",
    pwd: "abc123",
    roles: [ { role: "dbOwner", db: "nameofthedatabase" } ]
  }
)
```

* Create the files ```drive_key.json``` and ```gmail_key.json``` in the folder ```config/google``` containing the data for authentication with Google APIs, or set it with a ```.env``` file like the following:

```bash
# GMail OAuth2 API information
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_GMAIL = CLIENT_ID
OAUTH_SECRET_GMAIL = SECRET
GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN = TOKEN
# Service account
OAUTH_SERVICE_ID_GMAIL = SERVICE_ID
OAUTH_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY_GMAIL = -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n KEY \n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n

# GDrive OAuth2 API information
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID_DRIVE = CLIENT_ID
OAUTH_SECRET_DRIVE = SECRET
DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN = TOKEN
# Service account
OAUTH_SERVICE_ID_GMAIL = SERVICE_ID
OAUTH_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY_GMAIL = -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n KEY \n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n
```

* Start the application in another terminal window (```nodemon``` will automatically restart your application every time you make a change in any ```.js``` file and save it, if you don't have the package, you can install it globally on your computer with ```npm install -g nodemon```):

```bash
nodemon app.js
```

* Open ```localhost:8081``` in your Browser and have fun!
